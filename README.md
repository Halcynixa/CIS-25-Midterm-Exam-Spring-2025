# Solution Explanations

## Part 1
1. The function takes the length and width and multiplies them together as that's the formula for the area of a rectangle.
2. I noticed a pattern in prime numbers greater than 7: if the number isn't divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, it's a prime number. Basically, my code first manually checks if the value is equal to all the prime numbers 7 and below, then I use the modulus operator to see if the value ISN'T divisible by the numbers I listed, if the modulus output isn't a 0, there's a remindar and thus it isn't divisible, so it's a prime number and returns true. However, if it is divisible by even one of the values, that means it's a composite number and returns false.
## Part 2
1. e
2. e
## Part 3
1. e
2. e
## Part 4
1. e
2. The code follows the definition of a leap year according to Wikipedia: "Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400."
## Part 5
1. e
## Part 6
1. e
