# Solution Explanations

## Part 1
1. e
2. I noticed a pattern in prime numbers greater than 7: if the number isn't divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, it's a prime number. Basically, my code first manually checks if the value is equal to all the prime numbers 7 and below, then I use the modulus operator to see if the value ISN'T divisible by the numbers I listed, if the modulus output isn't a 0, there's a remindar and thus it isn't divisible, so it's a prime number and returns true. However, if it is divisible by even one of the values, that means it's a composite number and returns false.
